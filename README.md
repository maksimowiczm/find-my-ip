### 📌 What is Find My IP?

**Find My IP** is a simple Android app that fetches and stores your current IP address. It helps you
maintain a history of your IP addresses and can log IP changes automatically in the background—no
need to open the app every time.

### ❓ Why was it created?

I needed a straightforward way to track my IP address history on my phone, so I built this app. Now
I use it as a playground for my Android development projects.
