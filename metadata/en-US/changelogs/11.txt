Breaking Changes
- Background worker has been reset (again)

New features
- history search
- save address network type
- copy IP
- choose which IPs should trigger notifications
- save network type in database

Notes
Since this release, address history is now a mandatory feature.
I made this decision because it aligns with the main goal of the app and simplifies the codebase.

All addresses saved in previous versions are automatically treated as Wi-Fi addresses.
